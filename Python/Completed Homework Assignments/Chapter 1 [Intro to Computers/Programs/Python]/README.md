## Exercise 5 (Compute Expression)
Write a program that displays the result of the following expression:

<br>

$$ \dfrac{9.5 * 4.5 - 2.5 * 3}{45.5 - 3.5} $$

<br>

## Exercise 7 (Approximate $\pi$)
$\pi$ can be computed using the following formula:

$$ \pi = 4 * (1 - \dfrac{1}{3} + \dfrac{1}{5} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{9} - \dfrac{1}{11} + â€‚ ... )$$

Write a program that displays the result of the two following expressions:
<br>

$$ 4(1 - \dfrac{1}{3} + \dfrac{1}{5} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{9} - \dfrac{1}{11})  $$
<br>

$$ 4(1 - \dfrac{1}{3} + \dfrac{1}{5} - \dfrac{1}{7} + \dfrac{1}{9} - \dfrac{1}{11} + \dfrac{1}{13} - \dfrac{1}{15})$$

## Exercise 11 (Recursive Population)
The U.S. Census Bureau porjects population based on the following assumptions:

- One birth every 7 seconds
- One death every 13 seconds
- One new immigrant every 45 seconds

Write a program to display the population for each of the next five years.\
Assume the current population is 312,032,486 and one year has 365 days.
