## Exercise 3 (Solving Systems of Equations)
Cramer's Rule can be used to solve 2x2 systems of linear equations of the following form:

$$ ax + by = e $$

$$ cx + dy = f $$

Write a program that prompts the user to enter $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, and $f$ and display the results for $x$ and $y$.\
If $ad - bc = 0$, report that the equation has no solution.
