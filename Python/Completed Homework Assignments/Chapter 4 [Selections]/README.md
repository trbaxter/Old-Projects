## Exercise 1 (Solving Quadratic Equations)
The two roots of a quadratic equation can be obtained using the following formula:

$$ x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}  $$

Where $b^2 - 4ac$ is called the _discriminant_ of the quadratic equation.\
If it is positive, the equation has two real roots.\
If it is zero, the equation has one real root.\
If it is negative, the equation has no real roots.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter values for $a$, $b$, and $c$ and displays the result based on the discriminant.\
If the discriminant is positive, display the two roots. If the discriminant is zero, display one root.\
Otherwise, display to the user that the equation has no real roots.

## Exercise 3 (Solving Systems of Equations)
Cramer's Rule can be used to solve 2x2 systems of linear equations of the following form:

$$ ax + by = e $$

$$ cx + dy = f $$

Write a program that prompts the user to enter $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, and $f$ and display the results for $x$ and $y$.\
If $ad - bc = 0$, report that the equation has no solution.
