## Exercise 2 (Great Circle Distance)
The great circle distance is the distance between two points on the surface of a sphere. \
Let ($x_1$ , $y_1$) and ($x_2$ , $y_2$) be the geographical latitude and longitude of two points.\
The great circle distance between the two points can be computed using the following formula:

$$ d = \text{radius} * \cos^{-1} \Big(\sin(x_1)*\sin(x_2) + \cos(x_1) * \cos(x_2) * \cos(y_1 - y_2) \Big)$$

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the latitude and longitude of two points on the Earth in degrees and displays the great circle distance between them.
