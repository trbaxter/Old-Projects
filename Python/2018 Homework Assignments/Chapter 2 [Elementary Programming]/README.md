## Exercise 9 (Calculate Wind-Chill Temperature)
In 2001, the National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill temperature to measure the coldness using temperature and wind speed. The formula is:

$$ t_{wc} = 35.74 + 0.6215 \cdot t_a - 35.75 \cdot v^{0.16} + 0.4275 \cdot t_{a} \cdot v^{0.16}  $$

Where $t_a$ is the outside temperature measured in °F, $v$ is the wind speed measured in mph,
and $t_{wc}$ is the wind-chill temperature. The formula cannot be used for wind speeds below
2 mph or for temperatures below -58 °F or above 41 °F.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between -58 °F and 41 °F and
a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 mph and displays the wind-chill temperature in °F.

## Exercise 10 (Calculate Minimum Runway Length)
Given an airplane's acceleration $a$ and take-off speed $v$, derive & compute the minimum runway length
required for an airplane to take off.\
\
Write a program that prompts the user to enter $v$ in m/s, the acceleration $a$ in m/s², and displays the minimum runway length in the proper units.
