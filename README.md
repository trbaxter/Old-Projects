This is a collection of coding projects and miscellaneous stuff I've worked on in the past.\
Details on the contents of each folder are provided below.

<br>

<h2>Java</h2>

- The fullstack capstone project I completed for the 2022 summer B2E tech track course at York Solutions.

- A Monte Carlo simulation that estimates the value of Ï€ to an arbitrary amount of precision.\
Includes a rough (but interesting) visual representation of the drawn concept from the details file.

<h2>Python</h2>

- Completed homework assignments from my 2018 Intro to Programming course at SCSU.\
(Textbook exercises are taken from *Intro to Programming Using Python* by Y. Daniel Liang)

- Two possible solutions for the archetypical "FizzBuzz" coding interview question. \
(One using the standard modulo approach, and one without using modulo)

<h2>Scientific Papers</h2>

- Published conference proceedings I worked on as a lead physics research assistant.
