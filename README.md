This is a collection of coding projects and miscellaneous stuff I've worked on in the past.\
Details on the contents of each folder are provided below.

<br>

<h2>Codewars Practice</h2>

- Coding challenges I've completed in JavaScript, Python, and SQL to practice my skills.


<br>

<h2>Java</h2>

- Beginner projects on introductory topics. Covers one or two features at most. 

- Intermediate projects exploring more difficult concepts or combining several basic concepts together.

- Advanced projects requiring a longer amount of time to complete due to the complexity involved.


<br>



<h2>Python</h2>

- Completed homework assignments from my 2018 Intro to Programming course at SCSU.\
(Textbook exercises are taken from *Intro to Programming Using Python* by Y. Daniel Liang)

- Two possible solutions for the archetypal "FizzBuzz" coding interview question. \
(One using the standard modulo approach and one without using modulo)

<br>

<h2>Scientific Papers</h2>

- Published conference proceedings I worked on as an undergraduate physics student.
