Things to test:

1.) Instantiate a SimpleDotCom object.

2.) Assign it a location (an array of 3 ints, like {2,3,4}).

3.) Create a String to represent a user guess. ("2", "0", etc.).

4.) Invoke the checkYourself() method passing it the fake user guess.

5.) Print out the result to see if it's correct ("passed" / "failed").
