Project motivation: Use the Monte Carlo estimation technique to determine the value of π with arbitrary precision.

Consider a square with a length of 1 containing 1/4th of a circle of radius 1:

|              *         |
|                 *      |
|      r = 1        *    |
|                     *  |

To perform the technique, we randomly throw darts at the square.
Only darts landing within the square are counted.

The probability of a dart randomly hitting any position inside the square is identical.
To estimate π, we need to calculate the probability that a dart lands within the quarter circle.

• P(dart within quarter circle) = Area of quarter circle / Area of 1x1 square

Because the area of the 1x1 square = 1, the probability can be simplified to the following:

• P(dart within quarter circle) = Area of quarter circle
                                = π/4

If this area is multiplied by 4, we can then experimentally determine the value of π.
